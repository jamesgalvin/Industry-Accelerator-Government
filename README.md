# Government Accelerator
Partners, developers and customers can use the Dynamics 365 government accelerator to build solutions for government organizations to advance their missions in the following areas:

* Public finance
* Public health and social services
* Public safety and justice
* Critical infrastructure

The Dynamics 365 government accelerator acts as an information blueprint. It includes an industry-specific data model and building blocks for use in government business processes and applications. The accelerator expands the [Microsoft Common Data Model](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/common-data-model/) to include a government data model with a standardized data schema. The schema includes tables, columns, metadata, and relationships to support government use cases, including programs, services, and benefits. This standardized data blueprint improves interoperability by unifying and shaping the data in a consistent form to use across applications, processes, and workflows in Microsoft Power Platform and Microsoft Dynamics 365. With a shared understanding of the data, partners and developers accelerate their time to value to deliver mission-focused solutions for government agencies.

## Microsoft Dynamics 365 Industry Accelerators

Dynamics 365 announced the Microsoft Power Platform, a connected app platform that unifies access to your data to enable ISVs, SIs, Partners and Customers to build intelligent, data driven, task focused business and analytic applications. Microsoft is focused on enabling a data culture where the Microsoft Power Platform acts as the glue across Dynamics 365 (CE, F&O, Talent), Office 365 (SharePoint, Teams), Power BI, Power Apps, Microsoft Flow, Azure and other 3rd party on-premise and cloud based solutions.

With the Power Platform providing a unified approach to building data driven solutions, the team is taking it one step further by introducing Industry Solution Accelerators. Accelerators are industry focused foundational components that enable ISVs and other solution providers, a way to build solutions that are based on industry standards supported and driven by Microsoft. Along with our Health Accelerator that was released during Inspire 2018, which you can read about here, we are focused on delivering accelerators for the following industries (but not limited too):
